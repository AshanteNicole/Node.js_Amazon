# Node.js_Amazon
Node.js_Amazon is similar to amazon. The user will have a list of items they can purchase from Bamazon's inventory. When the program is first run, a list of available items will appear with the following information:

Item ID
Product Name
Department Name
Price
Quantity

The user will be prompted to answer the following question: "What is the ID of the product you would like to purchase?" The user will key in the Item ID.  

Then the user will be prompted with a second question: "How many would you like to purchase?" The user will key in the quantity. If there is sufficient stock, node.js display a message saying "Plenty in Stock" and ill calculate the amount the customer's card was charged. If there isn't insufficient stock, node.js will inform the customer there is insufficient stock.

 Once an item is purchased, the stock quantity will decrease by the number of items purchased previously.

This program is helpful to businesses that sell items online.  The company's inventory is updated once the purchase is made. 

The link below is a video that demostrates how the program works.
